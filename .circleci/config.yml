orbs:
  # The Node.js orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can utilize
  # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks.
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node
  codecov: codecov/codecov@3.0.0

jobs:
  # Below is the definition of your job to build and test your app, you can rename and customize it as you want.
  build-and-test:
    # These next lines define a Docker executor: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
    # You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of our Convenience Images from CircleCI's Developer Hub.
    # A list of available CircleCI Docker Convenience Images are available here: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:current-browsers
    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
